**Abstract.** This paper exposes the correlations between weather conditions and the number of fires in Australia. It will explore the impact of temperature and precipitation variations between 2008 and 2017, with the aim of finding correlations between these variables and the number of fires. The study also used machine learning algorithms to try to predict, given a certain weather condition, the number of fires that will occur on a given day.

# Australia-weather-and-fire-analysis

## Motivation
This project aims to investigate the impact of climate change on forest fires in Australia. After analyzing the data, it is expected that three main questions will be answered, namely: Is there a correlation between the increase in temperature and the number of fire outbreaks? Is it possible to predict the number of fire outbreaks in a given month/year based on their temperature variation? And how can local weather conditions affect a fire outbreak?
With the answers to these questions, it is possible not only to make better informed decisions for creating climate policies, but also to organize faster responses to fire outbreaks and create prevention plans for areas considered to be at risk.
